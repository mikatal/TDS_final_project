In the domains of Machine Learning and Data Mining, association rules illustrate relationships between variables
within extensive datasets. These rules identify the connections between items in any transaction involving a
diverse range of items. Association rules are mainly measured by support and confidence, and are generated by
a variety of algorithms, such as Apriori. In the algorithm, there are thresholds that should be fixed prior to the
run, and those affect the outcome rules â€“ it may produce trivial association rules or irrelevant ones.
In order to get informative and meaningful rules, we suggest an association rules mining technique where
we first cluster similar samples, extract the most significant features of each cluster, and then mine each cluster
for association rules independently.
To overcome this problem and raise the chances of the generated association rules to be informative, we propose an association rules mining technique where we first cluster similar samples and then mine each cluster for
its association rules independently. We try to show that doing so results in mining of more insightful association
rules. We hope to see more insightful association rules by performing this technique.
